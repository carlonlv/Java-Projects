 Run the program. You should see a window containing a couple of funny-looking chickens and pigs. There is also a "human" that occasionally scatters food, which the animals are supposed to eat, and the human tries to pick up eggs and manures. The animals move toward food when it drops, and eat it if they get to it first. The animals defecate once for each time they have eaten food.
